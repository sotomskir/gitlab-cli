## goops pipeline common

Sets environment variables, and runs common tasks. Should be called prior to other pipeline commands

### Synopsis

Sets environment variables, and runs common tasks. Should be called prior to other pipeline commands.
This command will call version and issues commands internally. And will save following variables to gitlab.env file:
CI_SEMVER_RELEASE, CI_SEMVER, CI_ISSUES. This way allows to share variables between pipeline stages.
Variables can be used in next stages by reading them from gitlab.env file, using command "source gitlab.env". 
If build is not in merge context CI_ISSUES will be fetched from previous merged merge request.
All CI_ISSUES will be assigned to CI_SEMVER_RELEASE version in Jira.
