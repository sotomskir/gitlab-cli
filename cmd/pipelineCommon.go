This command will call version and issues commands internally. And will save following variables to gitlab.env file:
CI_SEMVER_RELEASE, CI_SEMVER, CI_ISSUES. This way allows to share variables between pipeline stages.
Variables can be used in next stages by reading them from gitlab.env file, using command "source gitlab.env". 
If build is not in merge context CI_ISSUES will be fetched from previous merged merge request.
All CI_ISSUES will be assigned to CI_SEMVER_RELEASE version in Jira.

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command

	// pipelineCommonCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// pipelineCommonCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
